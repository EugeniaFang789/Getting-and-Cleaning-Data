# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

# This project is aimed at dealing with the UCI HAR Dataset

# First, load original dataset into R and merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
# Then load the label file into R and Uses merge function names to name the activities in the data set
# Next labels the data set variables with descriptive colnames
# Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement by select specific cols
# Finally, from the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
# variable for each activity and each subject and wirte the dataset out
